    <p>1. The top left section details fleet power, move speed and seige damage. Fleet power looks to be a combination of ship firepower, squad capacity, ship trait
      levels + Mutaplasmid (from invention star levels) and commander talent levels. A fleet with a 3 star ships and commanders with maxed talents/traits you can expect
      to level at around 2.6m. 0 star ship and commanders maxes at about 2.3m. Move speed defaults at 50 for seige formation, 100 for other formations. There is a research
      bonus that adds 50 movement for assault formation when maxed and 25 movement to seige formation when maxed. Seige damage starts at 250 for seige formation and 125dmg for 
      all other formations. Research again can increase this amount, but generally not by a lot.
    </p>

    <p>2. This shows the current bonuses that apply to the fleet. Formation bonus is based on the the ship and commander bonus's to the selected formation. If only one ship/commander
      has the bonus (icon on the ship/commander portrait) then the bonus will be 5%. If all three have that formation the bonus will be 15%. Faction bonus is dependant on ship faction.
      If both ship and both commanders all belong to the same faction the faction bonus is given. Depending on research a maximum of 10% bonus is given.  Recommended commander bonus
      is given if both commanders used appear in the ships recommended commander list.
    </p>

    <p>3. Formations: See tab <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="openTab(event, 'Formations')">Formations</a></p>

    <p>4. Here you can swap out ships and commanders. See the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="openTab(event, 'Combinations')">Combinations</a> tab for more details.
    </p>

    <p>5. Squad Capacity is determined by a number of items. The ship has a basic squad capacity determined by the Control Tower research and the number of commanders. If the Control
      Tower is researched to 5000 squads a fleet will get 5000 squads per commander, or 10,000 squads for two commanders. Each commander also comes with 100 squads per level up
      to a maximum if 5000 squads at level 50. Commanders and ships will also get bonus squads at certain promotion levels. Total squad capacity of un-promoted ships and commanders
      is 30,000 squads. This is why Control Tower research is essential in the early game. It greatly increases the effectiveness of your fleets.

      Formations and formation bonus play an important role in PVP.  Not so much in PVE as the fleet formations on RSS are usually random, so for PVE play to your fleets strength.
      For PVP those who want to get around the map quickly use Assault formation. For those defending structures from enemy combatants use intercept to counter assault formation.
      Lastly for weaker fleets sieging a citadel or gate use the seige formation. Note that when the ship and two commanders have matching formation bonus a yellow thumbs icon
      will show.<br><br> <span style="color:greenyellow"><b>Note:</b>Formations can only be changed at your base HQ, they can not be

      One of the most common questions I get is which commanders to use with which fleets.  There is no easy answer to this. We have a list of fleets that seem to work under
      <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="changeContentParent('./fleet_building.html')">Fleet Building</a> that should help. In general I try and match commander abilities
      that compliment each other. Normally I will try and get one repairer with a DPS. In the future for PVP I will likely try and pair a damage dealer with an ECM/Force Shield
      commander but for the moment the tanks (repairers like Santimona) are just OP in this game.
