    <p>1. The top left section details basic summary information on the ship.  The top row is the name of the faction and name of the ship. Faction is important when choosing
      commanders later on in <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="changeContentParent('./content_template.html')">Fleet</a> construction. The second row shows the formations
      which this ship will give bonus's too and ship size. Ship size changes number of ships per squad (Frigate=5, Destroyer=4, Cruiser=3, Battle Cruiser=2, Battleship=1). 
      The third line shows ship firepower which impacts the fleet power. This is a summation of HP/Firepower/Traits. As one increases this value increases. Lastly the icons 
      here can be clicked and indicate what use the ship can be used for. Options include uses such as Offence, Support, Drones and ECM. Since Eve GC doesn't yet have 
      multi-fleet attack options hopefully this will have greater usefullness in future updates.
    </p>

    <p>2. This shows the current rank of the ship. This can be increased using the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="openTab(event, 'Invent')">Invent button</a>
    </p>

    <p>3. Here you can find the basic attributes of the ships. Of note, make sure when comparing to compare to equivilent ship size. I.e don't compare a firgate HP to a Cruisers HP.

              This also includes getting off effects such as ECM Jam (Prevents other player from firing) or Force Shield (reduces incomming damage). The author highly recomends keeping
              this in mind when choosing ships. The big issue with ships like the Omen and Oracle is they are the last to fire and their weapon takes two turns to fire. This means
              you can have half your fleet destroyed before even firing a shot.

    <p>4. Ship Traits.  These determine what type of ship module will be used. They roughly fall into four categories. Weapon, Repair, Distruptor or Support. Weapons generally go
      boom boom but may include things like drones which act a little like a 2nd ship. Repair will repair damaged, but not destroyed, ships during battle. Disrupters are things 
      like ECM jammers or neural shutdowns, these will cause a ship or commander to fail to use their traits and abilities. Support includes things like increased firepower, armor or quick response. 
      <br><br>
      Ship traits cost both cards and isk to enable and raise their level. Isk increase up to $250,000 at level 15. For the card requirements:

  <div id="Invent" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Invent</h3>
    <img src="./img/ships/ships2.jpg" class="game_image" />
    <p>
      The Invent screen is fairly self explanitory. There are 5 stars with 5 arms each.  Each invention will cost you a certain amount of BP's per arm. Initially the cost is 2 
      bp per arm, increasing to 4bp on the 5th arm. For each star it requires these number of BP's
      <ul>
        <li>1 Star - 12bp's</li>
        <li>2 Star - 33bp's</li>
        <li>3 Star - 68bp's</li>
        <li>4 Star - 153bp's</li>
        <li>5 Star - 300bp's</li>
      </ul>
      The line driectly underneith shows what attribute will be increased with the next arm.  When getting 5 arms (a star) the ships Mutaplasmid will be increased.
      The Mutaplasmid confers either negative effects on traits when not reached or increases the effectiveness when reached.  For example ECM jam chance of occuring
      may drop by 10% until the Mutaplasmid for that trait is reached or a weapon may increase damage once the Mutaplasmid is reached. First star applies to first 
      trait, second star to second trait ... fifth star generally increases all basic attributes

    <p>The Legendary Data Chip can also be swapped for a ship blueprint by hitting the plus button. These chips come from events, corp rewards or pirates.</p>

  <div id="Recomended" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Recomended Commanders</h3>
    <img src="./img/ships/ships4.jpg" class="game_image" />
    <p>
      Recomended Commanders are the commanders that will gain a bonus if set as primary and secondary commanders. Sometimes there may be three or four commanders available 
      but in all cases both primary and secondary commander must be from this list to get the bonus. The bonus is often +10 Data Rate or +10% damge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this authors honest opinion in most cases this bonus doesn't outweigh the weaknesses of the recomended commanders. Far better to choose better commanders with a matching
      faction and ignore the bonus. Often the recomended commanders also don't have matching formation bonus as well. CCP should definately tidy this up and grant better bonuses
