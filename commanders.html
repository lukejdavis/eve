    <p>1. The top left section details basic summary information on the commander. The top row is the name of the
      faction and name of the commander. Faction is important when constructing a <a href="javascript:void(0);"
        onclick="changeContentParent('./content_template.html')">Fleet</a>. The second row shows the
      formations which this commander will give bonus's too.
      Lastly the icons here can be clicked and indicate what use the commander can be used for. Options include uses
      such as Offence, Support,
      Drones and repair.

      2. This shows the current rank of the commander. This can be increased using the <a href="javascript:void(0);"
        onclick="openTab(event, 'Promote')">Promote button</a>. <br><br>It also shows the Command Matrix active icon
      which
      indicates the Command Matrix is unlocked (3 Star rank). This gives an extra 300 squads to the fleet and +20
      stamina. <br><br>

    <p>3. Here you can find the basic attributes of the commanders.

        <td>In a fleet the number of squads is determined by the ship depending on research (Control Tower) and the
          commanders. If your
          reseach on control tower is 10/10 (10,000 squads) Then adding a level 1 commander will give 10,100 squads. Two
          level 1 commanders will
          give a squad capacity of 20,200 squads. Each commander level gives an extra 100 squads for a total of 50
          levels and 5000 squads.
          Promotion level will also increase squad capacity. With unpromoted commanders, two max level commanders will
          give a total squad

            (reduces incomming damage). The author highly recomends keeping

    <p>4. Commander Talents. These determine what type of ship module will be used. They roughly fall into four
      categories.
      Weapon, Repair, Distruptor or Support. Weapons generally go
      boom boom but may include things like drones which act a little like a 2nd ship. Repair will repair damaged, but
      not destroyed, ships during battle. Disrupters are things
      like ECM jammers or neural shutdowns, these will cause a ship or commander to fail to use their traits and
      abilities. Support includes things like increased firepower, armor or quick response.
      <br><br>
      Commander talents cost cards to enable. To raise their levels simply level the commander. You will get 1
      talent point for each level gained. Promotion will also give extra talent points. For
      the card requirements to enable:

    <h3>Promote</h3>
    <img src="./img/commanders/commander4.jpg" class="game_image" />
    <p>
      The Promote screen is fairly self explanitory. There are 5 stars with 5 arms each. Each promotion will cost you a
      certain amount of BP's per arm. Initially the cost is 2
      bp per arm, increasing to 4bp on the 5th arm. For each star it requires these number of BP's
    <ul>
      <li>1 Star - 12bp's</li>
      <li>2 Star - 33bp's</li>
      <li>3 Star - 68bp's</li>
      <li>4 Star - 153bp's</li>
      <li>5 Star - 300bp's</li>
    </ul>
    The line driectly underneith shows what attribute will be increased with the next arm. When getting 5 arms (a star)
    the commander will unlock an extra talent or gain more talent points.

    <p>The Legendary Data Chip can also be swapped for a commander blueprints by hitting the plus button. These chips come
      from events, corp rewards or pirates.</p>
