    <p>1. The top left section details basic summary information on the ship.  The top row is the name of the faction and name of the ship. Faction is important when choosing
      commanders later on in <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="changeContentParent('./content_template.html')">Fleet</a> construction. The second row shows the formations
      which this ship will give bonus's too and ship size. Ship size changes number of ships per squad (Frigate=5, Destroyer=4, Cruiser=3, Battle Cruiser=2, Battleship=1). 
      The third line shows ship firepower which impacts the fleet power. This is a summation of HP/Firepower/Traits. As one increases this value increases. Lastly the icons 
      here can be clicked and indicate what use the ship can be used for. Options include uses such as Offence, Support, Drones and ECM. Since Eve GC doesn't yet have 
      multi-fleet attack options hopefully this will have greater usefullness in future updates.
    </p>

    <p>2. This shows the current rak of the ship. This can be increased using the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="openTab(event, 'Invent')">Invent button</a>
    </p>

    <p>3. Here you can find the basic attributes of the ships. Of note, make sure when comparing to compare to equivilent ship size. I.e don't compare a firgate HP to a Cruisers HP.

            incomming damage by 10%</td>

    <p>4. Ship Traits.  These determine what type of ship module will be used. They roughly fall into four categories. Weapon, Repair, Distruptor or Support. Weapons generally go
      boom boom but may include things like drones which act a little like a 2nd ship. Repair will repair damaged, but not destroyed, ships during battle. Disrupters are things 
      like ECM jammers or neural shutdowns, these will cause a ship or commander to fail to use their traits and abilities. Support includes things like increased firepower, armor or quick response. 
      <br><br>
      Ship traits cost both cards and isk to enable and raise their level. Isk increase up to $250,000 at level 15. For the card requirements:
